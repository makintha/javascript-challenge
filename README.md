## Background
We are to build webpage to generate table dynamically depending on the filter implemented

## Level 1
On this challenge, we are to create dynamic table based on one filter criteria, date.

The table of the whole data is initially plotted in the webpage. Once the filter implemented the table will be updated. 

The filtered table is generated using filter button/"Enter" key method.

The table of the filtered data is generated using the function that use `this` `attribute` to record any change on the filter input. Any change happen to the record this will triggered filter and the table is updated accordingly.
